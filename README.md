Staytment.Shared
============

## This code was entirely written offline. It probably doesn't work yet because it isn't tested yet.

A shared Staytment api library that can be used in universal apps (Windows (Phone) 8.1).

`Staytment.Shared (Desktop)` contains a seperate compiled version for usage with applications that use the full .NET Framework 4.5 (desktop applications, ASP.NET and stuff).
